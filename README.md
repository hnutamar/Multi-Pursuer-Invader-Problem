# Multiple Pursuer Invader problem
This project explores problem of defending moving target against possible invaders using vortex field approach.
## Simulator
To create virtual environment with dependencies, run:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To use 2D simulator, run:
```
cd src/
python sim2D.py
```
To use 3D simulator, run:
```
cd src/
python sim3D.py
```
## Acknowledgments / Credits
This project uses the physics simulation and rendering environment from **[gym-pybullet-drones](https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones)**, developed by the Dynamic Systems Lab at the University of Toronto. 
I modified their `CtrlAviary` and `DSLPIDControl` modules to serve as a low-level flight controller tracking the kinematic trajectories generated by my high-level multi-agent path planning algorithms.
